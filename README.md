# beltcross
A computer program calculating the closest approaches of asteroid to the mean orbits of meteoroid streams.
This is the old version of the program. The new version can be found on:
https://github.com/neslusan/BELTCROSS2
In the output in the new version, there are provided, in addition, the components of the heliocentric radius vector of asteroid in the moment of its closest approach to the mean orbit of given shower and heliocentric velocity vectors of the asteroid and hypothetical meteoroid moving in the mean orbit of the shower in this moment.
